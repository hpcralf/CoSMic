\title{CoSMic: COVID-19 spatial microsimulation for Germany}
\description{
A calibration-microsimulation approach to reduce uncertainty for policy decisions on non-pharmacological interventions in the COVID-19 pandemic. The package implements an age-structured spatial microsimulation model that extends the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework. Using an optimization approach based on subnational trends in the number of intensive care patients, it is able to calibrate the model to the ongoing spread of the epidemic and tries to estimate how the NPIs have affected it. Based on these estimates the model can provide national and sub-national forecasts for trends in the number of ICU patients and other indicators under different scenarios regarding NPIs.
